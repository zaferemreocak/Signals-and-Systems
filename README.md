# Signals and Systems

    This repository contains 4 practices which are implemented in Python within the curriculum of Signals and Systems course.
    
- First Practice
In this program, a gray-scale picture has been taken and applied 4 different filters on it with zero and wrapping types of bordering.

- Second Practice
In this program, 4 face template images has been taken and got average of them. Following this process, this average template image has been used as a kernel and has been tried to detect faces on a test images.

- Third Practice
In this program, a voice record has been taken as input and cut the upper and lower frequencies and then played again. Finally, what kind of variances has been occured noted. In order to cut the upper/lower frequencies, Python's fourier transformation(fft, ifft) used deeply.

- Fourth Practice
In this program, a voice record has been taken as input and normalizations has been made such that there were 3 different records in one single file. Eventually, all records has been listened to and write down to the report with image support.
